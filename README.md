# üöÄ LFI Payloads

Welcome to **LFI Payloads**! This repository is designed to help security researchers and penetration testers identify and exploit **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerabilities with effective payloads. üõ°Ô∏è

## üìÇ What is LFI?
**Local File Inclusion (LFI)** is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. This can potentially lead to:

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Information Disclosure
- üêç Code Execution
- üî• Server Compromise
